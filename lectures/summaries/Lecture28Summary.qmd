## Ethics in Modern AI

### Current Challenges

- Increasing accessibility of AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT) to general public

- Growing capability to create realistic-looking fake information

- Potential for harmful applications:

  - Misinformation and synthetic media (deepfakes)

  - Personalized cyberbullying

  - Identity theft and catfishing

  - Privacy violations

- Need for ethical frameworks to guide AI development and deployment

### Ethical Frameworks

#### Utilitarianism

- **Core principle**: Maximize happiness, minimize harm for the greatest number

- **Application to AI**: Evaluate based on broad societal outcomes

- **Strengths**:

  - Practical and outcome-focused

  - Considers widespread impacts

  - Clear criterion (maximize welfare)

- **Weaknesses**:

  - Requires quantification of harm/benefit

  - May sacrifice minority interests

  - Can justify harmful means for "positive" ends

#### Deontology

- **Core principle**: Follow universal ethical rules and duties, regardless of outcomes

- **Application to AI**: Focus on respecting rights and following ethical constraints

- **Strengths**:

  - Provides clear ethical boundaries

  - Protects individual rights

  - Promotes consistency

- **Weaknesses**:

  - May ignore beneficial outcomes

  - Difficult to resolve conflicting duties

  - Can be inflexible in complex situations

#### Virtue Ethics

- **Core principle**: Develop moral character and virtues; act as a morally virtuous person would

- **Application to AI**: Design systems that embody positive moral values

- **Strengths**:

  - Integrates moral reasoning beyond rules

  - Acknowledges complexity of ethical decisions

  - Focuses on intention and character

- **Weaknesses**:

  - Less concrete guidance

  - More questions than answers

  - Subjective interpretations

## Ethical Pillars for AI Development

### Fairness

- AI should promote equity and treat individuals/groups without discrimination

- Challenges:

  - AI systems amplify existing societal biases if unchecked

  - Biased outcomes erode trust in AI systems

- Potential solutions:

  - Datasheets for datasets (transparency)

  - Active bias detection and mitigation strategies

  - Diverse training data and development teams

### Truthfulness

- AI should produce content that accurately represents reality

- Systems should transparently disclose artificial origins

- Challenges:

  - Increasing capability creates more convincing falsehoods

  - Tension between complexity/capability and potential for misuse

  - Difficulty differentiating AI-generated from human content

### Consent

- AI should respect individual autonomy through explicit permission

- Challenges:

  - Determining appropriate consent mechanisms

  - Navigating existing content (e.g., social media)

  - Intellectual property concerns (e.g., training on copyrighted material)

- Examples:

  - GitHub Copilot trained on public repositories containing proprietary code

  - AI art generators replicating copyrighted artistic styles

### Open Questions

- No definitive answers to many ethical dilemmas in AI

- Responsibility falls to technically informed experts who understand the tools

- Ongoing dialogue required as technology advances
