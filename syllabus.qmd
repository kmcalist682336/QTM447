## Problem Sets (50%)

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Overview

- 6-7 problem sets throughout the semester
- Can be completed in groups of up to 3 students
- Each problem set includes:
  - Theoretical exercises (derivations and proofs)
  - Coding exercises
  - Real-world data applications

### Submission Guidelines

- Use Quarto or Jupyter notebooks for submissions
- Submit both source file (.qmd or .ipynb) and rendered HTML/PDF
- Include all required package dependencies
- Write-ups should be clear and concise
- Each student must submit individually, even when working in groups

### Late Policy

- One "freebie" allowed for a 5-day extension on any problem set
- Beyond the freebie: 10% penalty per day late
- Weekends count as a single day
- No assignments accepted more than 5 days late without prior approval

## Final Project (50%)

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Overview

A significant application or methodological extension of course topics, divided into three deliverables:

| Component | Weight | Due Date |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Project Proposal | 5% | March 25, 2025 |
| Project Poster | 20% | April 25, 2025 |
| Final Deliverable | 25% | May 7, 2025 |

### Project Proposal (5%)

- Due: March 25th, 12:00 PM
- One slide presentation
- 90-second pitch
- Submit proposal slide to Canvas

### Project Poster (20%)

- Present at QTM DataBlitz on April 25th, 2025
- Demonstrate substantial progress
- Poster printing instructions will be provided in April

### Final Deliverable (25%)

- Due: May 7th, 2025, 11:59 PM EST
- Scientific paper format (max 15 pages)
- Include figures and tables
- Submit reproducible code repository
- Can be submitted as .zip or GitHub repository

### Guidelines

- Work in groups of up to 3 students
- Choose a novel dataset or methodological extension
- Avoid basic comparisons on standard datasets (e.g., MNIST)
- Consult with instructor during office hours after spring break
- For generative approaches, reading ahead may be necessary

## Grading Scale

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Scale

| Grade | Range |
|-------|-------|
| A     | 93-100% |
| A-    | 90-92%  |
| B+    | 87-89%  |
| B     | 83-86%  |
| B-    | 80-82%  |
| C+ and below | < 80% |

### No Curve Policy

There is no curve for final course grades. If everyone scores high enough for an A, everyone will receive an A. There is no competition for grades.

### Grade Appeals

If you believe your grade on any assignment is incorrect:

1. Wait 48 hours before submitting an appeal (unless it's a simple addition error)
2. Submit concerns in writing
3. Fully summarize the problems and justification for the appeal
